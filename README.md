# Goodreads Top-Rated Books Analysis (2000-2013)

![Books](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87e03a10-a1e1-4c7b-8c1b-26dd0a7609d9)

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of top-rated books on Goodreads over a 14-year period. Using Power BI, the analysis explores the relationships between genres, authors, publication years, and reader engagement metrics.

## What the Project Does

The project transforms raw book data into actionable insights through several key visualizations:

* **Genre Trends:** Tracks the year-over-year prevalence of the top 5 genres (Fiction, Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, and Contemporary).
* **Author Performance:** Identifies the most frequently appearing authors (e.g., Richelle Mead, Stephen King) and maps their specific genre associations.
* **Reader Engagement:** Compares average ratings against the total number of ratings to distinguish between "niche" high-performers and "broad appeal" hits.
* **Unexpected Discoveries:** Uncovers less common genre categories discovered during the analysis, such as **MMF**, **Church**, and **Spain**.
* **Historical Trends:** Analyzes how average ratings and reader volume shifted annually between 2000 and 2013.

## Why the Project is Useful

This analysis is valuable for several reasons:

* **Trend Identification:** It highlights the rise of the Young Adult genre in the late 2000s, providing historical context for publishing trends.
* **Engagement Strategy:** It demonstrates that a high rating doesn't always mean a high volume of readers, helping researchers understand different types of "success" in literature.
* **Market Insights:** For authors or publishers, it identifies which genres (like Comic Strips) maintain the highest average satisfaction among readers.
* **Niche Exploration:** It brings to light specific sub-genres that might otherwise be overlooked in broader market summaries.
